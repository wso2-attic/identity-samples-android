# Run this Android Sample App 

## Register Application

1. Register an application with the following callback-url.

    | Field                 | Value         | 
    | --------------------- | ------------- | 
    | Service Provider Name | sample-app  |
    | Description           | This is a mobile application  | 
    | Call Back Url         | wso2sample://oauth2  | 

2. Enable following properties:
- PKCE Mandatory
- Allow authentication without the client secret

3. Get the client-id

## Configure the Android SDK

### Build the SDK locally

1. Clone this project: https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-sdks-android.git
    `git clone https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-sdks-android.git`

3. Build the library in your local maven. Run the following commands. Now the library will be
 available in your local .m2 cache. 
    - `./gradlew clean assembleRelease`
    - `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal `

## Configure the sample

#### Configuration


Add the relevant configs in oidc_config.json file located in `res/raw` folder. 

- Add the client-id of the application.
- Update the {HOST_NAME}:{PORT} with the IS server's hostname and port respectively

```json
{
 "client_id": {client-id},
 "redirect_uri": "wso2sample://oauth2",
 "authorization_scope": "openid",
 "discovery_uri": "https://{HOST_NAME}:{PORT}/oauth2/oidcdiscovery/.well-known/openid-configuration"
}
```

Example:

```json
"client_id": "rs5ww91iychg9JN0DJGLMaxG2gha",
 "redirect_uri": "wso2sample://oauth2",
 "authorization_scope": "openid",
 "discovery_uri": "https://stgcloud.kubesb.com/t/example/oauth2/oidcdiscovery/.well-known/openid-configuration"
}
```

## Run your application

## Running in an Android Emulator

1. Create a suitable Android Virtual Device in the Android Studio.

2. If the WSO2 IS is hosted in the local machine, change the domain of the endpoints in the “app
/res/raw/oidc_config.json” file to “10.0.2.2”. Refer the documentation on [emulator-networking](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-networking)
3. Bydefault IS uses a self-signed certificate. If you are using the default pack without
    changing to a CA signed certificate, follow this [android guide] (https://developer.android.com
    /training/articles/security-config) to get rid of SSL issues.
4. Change the hostname of IS as 10.0.2.2.
    - Create a new keystore with CN as localhost and SAN as 10.0.2.2

        ```shell script
        keytool -genkey -alias wso2carbon -keyalg RSA -keystore wso2carbon.jks -keysize 2048 -ext SAN=IP:10.0.2.2
        ```

    - Export the public certificate (name it as wso2carbon.pem)to add into the truststore.
        ```shell script
        keytool -exportcert -alias wso2carbon -keystore wso2carbon.jks -rfc -file wso2carbon.pem
        ```
    - Import the certificate in the client-truststore.jks file located in <IS_HOME>/repository
    /resources/security/
       ```shell script
      keytool -import -alias wso2is -file wso2carbon.pem -keystore client-truststore.jks
             -storepass wso2carbon
       ```
    - Now copy this public certificate (wso2carbon.pem) into the res/raw folder

5. Run the application.

6. Select the Virtual Device and test the application. 

## Running in an Android Device
1. Enable USB Debugging in the Developer Options in the Android Device. Refer documentation on
 [Run your App](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app).

2. If the WSO2 IS is hosted in the local machine, change the domain of the endpoints in the `app
/res/raw/oidc_config.json` file and the hostnames specified under `hostname` config
in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file to the IP Address of local machine. 
Make sure that both the Android Device and the local machine is connected to the same WIFI network.

3. Connect the Android Device to the machine through a USB cable.

4. Run the application.

5. Select the Android Device as the Deployment Target.

6. Test the application.
